The final event at Rose House this semester was a sourdough focaccia workshop, which I called *Get the Focaccia Here* (I was far too pleased with the name, can you tell?).
It was really quite a hit!
Teaching artisinal baking is tricky because there's so much downtime.
On the one hand, you need your students to understand the downtime and learn the visual cues that might prompt them to move from step to step.
On the other hand, ain't nobody got time for an eight-hour lesson.
It took a fair bit of planning to get it all done in a short session for my Rose residents.
Here's my lesson plan, which was inspired by the excellent [sourdough boule class](https://www.seawolfbakers.com/classes) I took at Sea Wolf a few years ago.

I set these ground rules:
- Most steps must be shown.
- There must be fresh-baked focaccia.
- The event must be about an hour long.

### Recipes

We will follow:
- [Big and Bubbly Focaccia](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/big-and-bubbly-focaccia-recipe)
- [Big and Bubbly Focaccia, Sourdough Edition](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/big-and-bubbly-focaccia-sourdough-edition-recipe)

The former is King Arthur's Recipe of the Year 2025, and the latter proceeds exactly in lockstep.
It's quite pedagogically useful that these recipes are so similar, and so I ask that you use these recipes even if you'd normally use something else.
The recipes are straightforward and well-written, and we'll mostly make them as written.

Print these off, and use a highlighter to mark the differences between the two recipes. There are only a few, and they're basically all about timing. Here's a representative example: step 11 of the yeast recipe calls for a rest of 1-1.5 hours, while step 11 of the sourdough recipe calls for a rest of 4-6 hours. More on this below.

This may sound a little wild, but I advocate that you actually make both of these recipes for your lesson.
Having the sourdough and yeast loaves available side by side will help your students understand the tradeoffs involved.

Here's your consolidated list of ingredients:
- All-purpose flour
  - I had King Arthur at hand, and I think they do a good job, but you'll be fine with what you've got.
- Salt
- Sugar
- Water
- Olive oil
- Your sourdough starter (mine is called Trixie)
- Active dry yeast
  - This is a divergence from the recipe, which calls for instant yeast. I will defend this below.

These are the toppings I had at hand. There's lot of latitude here.
- Fresh rosemary
- Maldon salt
- Kalamanta olives
- Sundried tomatoes

As to equipment:
- Scale
- Clingwrap
- Flexible spatula
- Large mixing bowl
  - You'll get away with just one bowl because the two recipes will mostly be made in sequence.
- Two 9-inch square baking pans
  - Here you won't get away with just one because the two recipes will be *baked* in parallel.
  - I have [this](https://www.oxo.com/non-stick-pro-cake-pan-9-in-square.html) from Oxo and I borrowed another.
- Oven that's large enough for two 9-inch baking pans.

### Pre-Lesson Prep

1. Decide what time your lesson will be.
I played myself and announced my lesson for 10am, which meant that I had to put in my first folds at 2am.
Don't be like me; announce a late afternoon lesson: 4pm on Day 1.

2. Your first folds will happen at 8am on Day 1. So at 8am, you will need [ripe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2016/05/17/ripe-sourdough-starter) starter. If you know how to achieve that, do what you need to do and skip the rest of this step. But if you're like me and your starter lives in the fridge and is fed every two weeks and you don't really know how she works, we'll need to feel things out a little.
    - Bring your starter out of the fridge at 4pm on Day 0 and gave it one 1:1:1 feed (1 part starter, 1 part flour, 1 part water) by weight.
    - Put it in an off oven with the oven light on.
    - Check on it at 10pm on Day 0.
      - If it's fully ripe, that means your cold and unfed starter went to fully ripe in 6 hours. Your starter is now warm and active, so another 1:1:1 feeding now will take even less time, and you'll miss the 8am connection you're hoping to make. So feed it again, but now with a 1:3:3 ratio (1 part starter, 3 parts flour, 3 parts water). The idea is to give your starter a bunch more land to conquer this time, which will slow it down so it only reaches its peak at ~8am on Day 1.
      - If it's not fully ripe at 10pm, check it at midnight on Day 0. Ripe? Feed it again with a 1:2:2 ratio. Not ripe? Feed it with a 1:1:1 ratio.

3. At 8am, start following the [sourdough recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/big-and-bubbly-focaccia-sourdough-edition-recipe). You should be done with your four bowl folds by 9:30am. You're now at step 7, and you can stick the whole bowl, wrapped with clingwrap, in the off oven with its light on.

4. At 11am, proceed by tipping the dough into the pan. I think making the parchment sling is super silly and I'd skip it. Wrap the pan tightly in clingwrap using the *cater wrap* technique (look this up) and stick it back in the off oven.

n. At 3:45pm, pull both your loaves out of the off oven. Pre-heat the oven with racks in the upper and lower thirds. Your students will arrive at 4pm. Sit down, have a seltzer.
