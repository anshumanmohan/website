[Sometimes a Great Notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sometimes_a_Great_Notion) is challenging and devastating.
[If You Have to be a Floor](https://thememorypalace.us/if-you-have-to-be-a-floor-the-met-residency-episode-6/) is a truly special podcast episode, while
[This is Chance](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/this-is-chance-redux/) is a story I'd consume in any medium.

On learning that I had seen no Ghibli movies at all, John and Tara threw me a monthslong film festival with themed dinners to match.
[You Want It Darker](https://youtu.be/YD6fvzGIBfQ") is a good song, and
[The Last Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Emperor) is a good movie.
