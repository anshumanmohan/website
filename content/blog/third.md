A large number of people whom I care about are in Singapore for a conference. Singapore has the greatest food in the world, and it would be a darn shame if my friends missed it. This is an exhortation to get out there and try some of it.

#### Hawker Centers

At the heart of Singapore's food scene is the [hawker center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre). If you skip these in favor of fancier places, that's fine, but you should feel at least a little bad because you ain't doing it right.

Where to go? If you want the encyclopedic treatment, my buddy Austin has you covered: [this](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1X4r_Xrevcvge3CCkgljnXWQZNxuXlBE&usp=sharing) map documents his meals at every single hawker center and contains great reccs for what to get at those places. He's even named the "Supreme Ten", which you could pick from.

It's easy to play the game too hard. Sure, there are famous hawker centers and famous stalls within those hawker centers, and sure you could go eat at that one stall that won a Michelin star. But really I think you should just go to a hawker center, any one really, and you'll begin to get it. Maybe you've done your research and you'll get a transendent wanton mee or char kway teow or hokkien mee or chicken rice. Or maybe you're on point-and-shoot mode and you'll end up with something less sexy. It doesn't matter. It will cost like $5 and it will be delicious. And you'll know you're doing it right.

#### Hawker+

One of the miracles of hawker food is its price. Regardless, here are a few places that charge you a few extra bucks and do further wonders with, essentially, hawker food.
