#### This is source code for my website, https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~amohan/. 

It is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), but it may not be the most elegant use of Zola.

Further, I do not yet deploy this website at each push using a Github Action; I run the shell script `deploy.sh` that builds and `scp`s the site over to Cornell's servers.
