#### This is source code for my website, https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~amohan/. 

It is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), but it may not be the most elegant use of Zola.

Further, I do not yet deploy this website at each push using a Github Action; I do a manual `scp` into Cornell's web servers instead.
