      <p> I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>'s <a
          href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>.
        My research sits at the intersection of programming languages, computer networks, and computer architecture.
        My advisor is <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Sampson</a>, and I have ongoing

      </p>
      <p> Before Cornell, I worked with
        <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hobor/">Aquinas Hobor</a> on CertiGraph, a Coq development for the formal
        verification of graph-manipulating programs written in C.
        <!-- Highlights include the verification of a garbage collector for the  -->
        <!-- CertiCoq compiler, the discovery of an overflow bug in Dijkstra's algorithm, -->
        <!-- and a refinement in the precondition of Prim's algorithm. </p> -->
        Before Aquinas, I was part of the inaugural cohort of
        <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/">Yale-NUS College</a>.
        I gave the commencement address for my graduating class.
        I grew up in Calcutta.

        Compilers for <em>accelerator design languages</em> translate
        high-level languages into application-specifichardware.
        These compilers rely on a control interface to compose hardware units.
        There are two choices: static control,
        which relies on cycle-level timing; and dynamic control, which
        uses explicit signalling to avoid depending on timing details.
        Static control is efficient but brittle; dynamic control incurs
        hardware costs to support compositional reasoning.
        We present a compiler that unifies static and dynamic
        control in a single intermediate language, and yields rich dividends.

        PIFO trees are an exciting primitive for programmable packet scheduling, but are poorly understood and
        underutilized.
        Part of the issue is that the expressivity of a PIFO tree is thought to be inextricably tied to its shape,
        meaning that
        expressing a <em>range</em> of scheduling policies would require a range of tree-shapes to be deployed in
        hardware.
        This is clearly untenable.
        In our work, we give PIFO trees a formal syntax and semantics, prove properties about the expressivity of PIFO
        trees as a function of their shape, and show how to break free of the connection between shape and
        expressivity.
        This comes together as a <em>compiler</em> that allows one to write a program &#8212 a scheduling algorithm
        &#8212
        against one PIFO
        tree but still deploy it on
        another PIFO
        tree of a different shape.
        If a sufficiently expressive PIFO tree is made available in hardware, our compiler can allow a range of
        scheduling policies to run on it.

      <p> While much of the law is up to human interpretation, property law has a more programmatic goal.
        An item is <i>conveyed</i> from person to person, and this conveyance may be
        affected by further conveyances, life events such as birth and death, and the satisfaction or
        dissatisfaction of arbitrary stipulations placed by conveyors.
        Through all of this, the law desires unambiguous ownership.
        Orlando is a DSL that addresses this problem through a novel use of techniques from PL, and Littleton is an
        interpreter that makes these techniques pedagogically useful.

      <p> We extend the CertiGraph library to enable reasoning about labeled edges
        and undirected graphs, and use it to verify
        C implementations of Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Kruskal's algorithms.
        Each of these classic algorithms has been used and studied for
        more than 60 years, and yet our verification reveals remarkable subtleties.
        We show that Dijkstra has an overflow issue that places delicate restrictions on
        the maximum allowable path cost. We also debunk the universal misconception that
        Prim runs correctly only on connected graphs.
        Our proofs are checked in Coq.

      <p> The Ackermann function \(\mathcal{A}\) grows explosively, and its inverse
        \(\alpha\) is of interest in CS. Sadly, the standard practice of computing
        \(\alpha\) via \(\mathcal{A}\) is untenable.
        We give a new and efficient computation of \(\alpha\).
        We also give efficient computations for the

      <p> Formally verifying graph algorithms is hard: nodes can be shared
        arbitrarily, so uninvolved subgraphs cannot be "framed away".
        We address this with a new separation logic rule
        called <span class="sc">localize</span>.
        We develop CertiGraph, a Coq library that provides a
        setup for defining mathematical graphs in Coq, laying them out in memory
        via separation logic,
        and stating and proving properties about them.
        We demonstrate the power of CertiGraph by using it to verify seven
        graph-manipulating C programs. Our flagship example is a
        generational garbage collector.
        We identify two places where the semantics of C is
        too restrictive to define
        OCaml-style GCs.
        Our proofs are checked in Coq. </p>
