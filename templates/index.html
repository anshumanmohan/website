    <div class="bio blurb">
      <p> I am a third-year PhD student at Cornell University.
        For the first half of 2023, I am visiting The University of Washington.
        My research is in programming languages. </p>
      <p> With <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Sampson</a>
        and others, I work on <a href="https://github.com/cucapra/pollen">Pollen</a>, a DSL-to-hardware compiler with
        applications to pangenomics.
        With <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/">Nate Foster</a> and others, I work on programmable packet
        scheduling.
        With <a href="http://james.grimmelmann.net/">James Grimmelmann</a>
        and others, I think about how computer science intersects with the law.
      </p>
      <p> Before Cornell, I worked with
        <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hobor/">Aquinas Hobor</a> and others
        on CertiGraph, a Coq development for the formal
        verification of graph-manipulating programs written in C.
        <!-- Highlights include the verification of a garbage collector for the  -->
        <!-- CertiCoq compiler, the discovery of an overflow bug in Dijkstra's algorithm, -->
        <!-- and a refinement in the precondition of Prim's algorithm. </p> -->
        Before Aquinas, I was part of the inaugural cohort of
        <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/">Yale-NUS College</a>.
        I gave the commencement address for my graduating class.

      <p> Science is for everyone, but scientific papers are not.
        My blog is a humble experiment in accessibility:
        I offer primers on research topics I care about, assuming no prior exposure to computer science.
        Because I cannot help myself, I will probably also write about food.

      <p> Part of the point of doing science is to have your work seen, used, and
        made redundant. Sadly, at the rate we're heating the planet, we'll
        soon have more rudimentary things to worry about. I'm cautiously
        optimistic about climate change, but with the understanding that
        intentional work is needed from everyone who can afford to put it in.
        I'm still working on my plan, so please reach out if you'd like to discuss
        this as either a mentor or a coconspirator.

      PIFO trees are an exciting primitive for programmable packet scheduling, but are poorly understood and
      underutilized.
      In this work, we give PIFO trees a formal syntax and semantics.
      We prove properties about the expressivity of PIFO trees as a function of their shape, and show that tall
      skinny trees are more expressive than short fat ones.
      We also show how the behavior of a PIFO tree of one shape can be simulated by another PIFO tree of another shape
      without an appreciable loss in performance.

    <p> We extend the CertiGraph library to enable reasoning about labeled edges
      and undirected graphs, and use it to verify
      C implementations of Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Kruskal's algorithms.
      Each of these classic algorithms has been used and studied for
      more than 60 years, and yet our verification reveals remarkable subtleties.
      We show that Dijkstra has an overflow issue that places delicate restrictions on
      the maximum allowable path cost. We also debunk the universal misconception that
      Prim runs correctly only on connected graphs.
      Our proofs are checked in Coq.

  <div class="ack blurb">
    <p> The Ackermann function \(\mathcal{A}\) grows explosively, and its inverse
      \(\alpha\) is of interest in CS. Sadly, the standard practice of computing
      \(\alpha\) via \(\mathcal{A}\) is untenable.
      We give a new and efficient computation of \(\alpha\).
      We also give efficient computations for the
      related and better-known hyperoperation hierarchy
      <span class="nowrap">(\(+\), \(\times\), exp, tetration, etc)</span>
      and its inverse
      <span class="nowrap">(\(-\), \(\div\), log, log\(^{*}\), etc)</span>.
      Our definitions are proved correct in Coq,
      and our time bounds are supported by pen-and-paper proofs and
      benchmarks after extraction to OCaml.

    <p> Formally verifying graph algorithms is hard: nodes can be shared
      arbitrarily, so uninvolved subgraphs cannot be "framed away".
      We address this with a new separation logic rule
      called <span class="sc">localize</span>.
      We develop CertiGraph, a Coq library that provides a
      setup for defining mathematical graphs in Coq, laying them out in memory
      via separation logic,
      and stating and proving properties about them.
      We demonstrate the power of CertiGraph by using it to verify seven
      graph-manipulating C programs. Our flagship example is a
      generational garbage collector.
      We identify two places where the semantics of C is
      too restrictive to define
      OCaml-style GCs.
      Our proofs are checked in Coq. </p>

  <div class="littleton-talk blurb">
    <p> While much of the law is up to human interpretation, property law has a more programmatic goal.
      An item is <i>conveyed</i> from person to person, and this conveyance may be
      affected by further conveyances, life events such as birth and death, and the satisfaction or
      dissatisfaction of arbitrary stipulations placed by conveyors.
      Through all of this, the law desires unambiguous ownership.
      Orlando is a DSL that addresses this problem through a novel use of techniques from PL, and Littleton is an
      interpreter that makes these techniques pedagogically useful.
